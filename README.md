# RBX-HTML

Roblox HTML Parser powered by [Lua-Htmlparser](https://github.com/msva/lua-htmlparser).

[1]: https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

## Installation

To install, either download the `http` folder into your project and use a sync tool like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo),
or download the `./http.rbxm` file and insert it into your game.

## Usage
Start off with
```lua
local html = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notpoiu/RBXL-HTML-Parser/refs/heads/master/html/init.lua"))()
```
Then, parse some html:
```lua
local root = html.parse(htmlstring)
```
Optionally, you can pass loop-limit value (integer). This value means the deepness of the tree, after which parser will give up. Default value is 100000.

The input to parse may be the contents of a complete html document, or any valid html snippet, as long as all tags are correctly opened and closed.
Now, find specific contained elements by selecting:
```lua
local elements = root:select(selectorstring)
```
Or in shorthand:
```lua
local elements = root(selectorstring)
```
This will return a list of elements, all of which are of the same type as the root element, and thus support selecting as well, if ever needed:
```lua
for _, element in ipairs(elements) do
	print(element.name)
	local subs = element(subselectorstring)
	for _, sub in ipairs(subs) do
		print(sub.name)
	end
end
```
The root element is a container for the top level elements in the parsed text, i.e. the `<html>` element in a parsed html document would be a child of the returned root element.

## Sets
Some data in this library is returned as a Set. If this is the case, you must call `set:to_list()` for a list of the Set's values.

## Selectors
Supported selectors are a subset of [jQuery's selectors][1]:

- `"*"` all contained elements
- `"element"` elements with the given tagname
- `"#id"` elements with the given id attribute value
- `".class"` elements with the given classname in the class attribute
- `"[attribute]"` elements with an attribute of the given name
- `"[attribute='value']"` equals: elements with the given value for the given attribute
- `"[attribute!='value']"` not equals: elements without the given attribute, or having the attribute, but with a different value
- `"[attribute|='value']"` prefix: attribute's value is given value, or starts with given value, followed by a hyphen (`-`)
- `"[attribute*='value']"` contains: attribute's value contains given value
- `"[attribute~='value']"` word: attribute's value is a space-separated token, where one of the tokens is the given value
- `"[attribute^='value']"` starts with: attribute's value starts with given value
- `"[attribute$='value']"` ends with: attribute's value ends with given value
- `":not(selectorstring)"` elements not selected by given selector string
- `"ancestor descendant"` elements selected by the `descendant` selector string, that are a descendant of any element selected by the `ancestor` selector string
- `"parent > child"` elements selected by the `child` selector string, that are a child element of any element selected by the `parent` selector string

Selectors can be combined; e.g. `".class:not([attribute]) element.class"`

## Element type
All tree elements provide, apart from `:select` and `()`, the following accessors:

### Basic
- `.name` the element's tagname
- `.attrs` a table with keys and values for the element's attributes; `{}` if none
- `.id` the value of the element's id attribute; `nil` if not present
- `.classes` an array with the classes listed in element's class attribute; `{}` if none
- `:content()` the raw text between the opening and closing tags of the element; `""` if none
- `.children` an array with the element's child elements, `{}` if none
- `.parent` the element that contains this element; `root.parent` is `nil`

### Other
- `.index` sequence number of elements in order of appearance; root index is `0`
- `:text()` the complete element text, starting with `"<tagname"` and ending with `"/>"` or `"</tagname>"`
- `:links()` an array with all the links in the document. Links are not guaranteed to be fully qualified URLs (use `:absolute_links()`).
- `:absolute_links(page_url, [http_only])` an array with all fully qualified links in the document. page_url should be the URL to the loaded document, used for links beginning with "/"
- `.level` how deep the element is in the tree; root level is `0`
- `.root` the root element of the tree; `root.root` is `root`
- `.descendants` a **Set** containing all elements in the tree beneath this element, including this element's `.children`; `{}` if none
- `.descendant_elements` a table with a key for each distinct tagname in `.descendants`, containing a **Set** of all deeper element nodes with that name; `{}` if none
- `.descendant_attrs` as `.descendant_elements`, but keyed on attribute name
- `.descendant_ids` as `.descendant_elements`, but keyed on id value
- `.descendant_classes` as `.descendant_elements`, but keyed on class name

## Limitations
- Attribute values in selector strings cannot contain any spaces
- The spaces before and after the `>` in a `parent > child` relation are mandatory 
- `<!` elements (including doctype, comments, and CDATA) are not parsed; markup within CDATA is *not* escaped
- Textnodes are no separate tree elements; in `local root = htmlparser.parse("<p>line1<br />line2</p>")`, `root.nodes[1]:getcontent()` is `"line1<br />line2"`, while `root.nodes[1].nodes[1].name` is `"br"`
- No start or end tags are implied when [omitted](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#optional-tags). Only the [void elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elements) should not have an end tag
- No validation is done for tag or attribute names or nesting of element types. The list of void elements is in fact the only part specific to HTML
